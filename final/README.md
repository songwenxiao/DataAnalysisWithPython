# Wenxiao Song final project

## Introduction

This final project contains five analysis. The first two analysis are trying to check that whether the supporting rate of Democrat and Republican has something to do with poverty rate or unemployment rate. The third one is trying to show that the median household income of all the state in the US. The last two analysis are trying to show some information about the certain state.

## Data Source description

The data source contains in 15 csv files. [Link to the data source](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/tree/master/final/data). 
The first, forth and fifth analysis are based on [xaa.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xaa.csv), [xab.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xab.csv), [xac.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xac.csv) and [xad.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xad.csv). 
The second analysis are based on all the csv file.
The third analysis are based on [xaa.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xaa.csv), [xab.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xab.csv), [xac.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xac.csv), [xad.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xad.csv) and [Unemployment.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/Unemployment.csv)

The [xaa.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xaa.csv), [xab.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xab.csv), [xac.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xac.csv) and [xad.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/xad.csv) are splited from one data file [usa-2016-presidential-election-by-county.csv](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/usa-2016-presidential-election-by-county/table/). They have the same columns.
The columns of these files are covered from state, county, votes, race ratio, poverty rate, business structure to age distriubtion. 
The sample data are shown below:

The [Unemployment.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/Unemployment.csv) contains some useful informations like state, unemployment rate from 2007 to 2015. 

The sample data of [Unemployment.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/Unemployment.csv) are shown below:

The [est05All.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/est05ALL.csv) to [est14All.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/est14ALL.csv) contains information like state, county, median househould income.

The sample data of [est05All.csv](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/data/est05ALL.csv) are shown below:

###Since all five analysis covers so many columns and they are so different from each other, I decide to put the collected data process into seperate analysis file. I will explain later in each analysis. 


## [Analysis01](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/tree/master/final/Analysis/Analysis01)

Input: 	Candidate Last Name(Trump or Hillary)

Output: Two bar plot. The first one shows the supporting rate of input candiate for all the state in the US, in descending order. The 		second bar plot shows that the poverty rate of state. The state order is the same as the first one.

Description: This analysis is trying to check whether their is a direct relation between the candiate supporting rate and the state 			poverty rate.

To do this analysis, run: 

    python Analysis01.py Hillary 
    
The out put would be shown as below:

    ![alt tag](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/blob/master/final/images/Analysis01_img02.png)
    
Conclution: From plots above, there is no direct relation between the candiate supporting rate and the state poverty rate.

###Deep into the code:

The first part of code as shown below, read the data and concat them together to make a new dataframe.

This code shown below collected the useful data from the original one.

This code shown below generate a new columns called 'Total.Population.Under.Poverty.Line'. It represent the total number of population under the poverty rate for each county. Then we sum up the total number of total population, votes, population under poverty according to the state. We will get the total number of population, votes, total number of people under poverty for every state.

## [Analysis02](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/tree/master/final/Analysis/Analysis02)

Input: 	State name for short

Output: Two pie plot. The first one shows the distribution of the education degree demography rate of the input state.
	The second one shows the racial demography distribution of the input state.
        
Description: This Analysis is trying to show you this two demography information of the certain state.

To do this analysis, run: 


    python Analysis02.py CA 

The out put would be shown as below:

The racial distribution code actually is using the same approach.


## [Analysis03](https://github.com/songwenxiao/DataAnalysisWithPython/tree/master/final/Analysis/Analysis03)

Input: 	State name for short

Output: One bar plot and one line plot. The bar plot shows the unemployment rate of the input state from 2007 to 2016.
	The line plot shows the supporting rate of two partys during the last three elections of the input state.
        
Description: This Analysis is trying to check whether their is a direct relation between the unemployment rate and the supporting rate 			of this two party.

note: This analysis merges two data source and make a new dataframe object

To do this analysis, run: 


    python Analysis03.py CA
